Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript

This is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Players take turns to mark X and O on the grid, with automatic win detection and the option to reset or start a new game.

What I am Going to Create:
1. Players take turns marking X and O on a 3Ã—3 grid, with real-time interaction.
2. The game checks for a winner or a draw, displaying messages accordingly.
3. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, with a reset button to start a new game.
